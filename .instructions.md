applyTo: ./frontend

Frontend uses:
- TypeScript
- Vue.js with Pinia for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Vite for build tooling
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Vitest for testing
- axiosInstance.ts for centralized Axios configuration, including snake_case to camelCase conversion
- anonymizationStore.ts for managing anonymization-related state and actions

Always follow these conventions and patterns when adding or modifying code in the frontend.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- Document your code and APIs clearly.
- Use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript variables and properties, even when the backend API is not available.
