Test Failures:

❌ "should populate patient options" 
   - Expected options.length > 2 but got 1
   - Store mock data (John Doe, Jane Smith) not reaching component
   - Only sees default disabled option

❌ "should enable examination select when patient is selected"
   - patientSelect.setValue(1) doesn't trigger store state update
   - Component conditional logic not working with mocked stores

❌ "should be enabled when both patient and examination are selected"  
   - Button remains disabled despite setValue() calls
   - Component v-if="selectedPatientId && selectedExaminationId" prevents UI updates

Root Cause:
- vi.mock() static mocks don't integrate with component's Pinia store instances
- Component uses usePatientStore() at runtime but gets different mock instance
- Missing createTestingPinia with initialState for deterministic component state
